Description: realtime console network usage monitor
 Nload is a console application which monitors network traffic and bandwidth
 usage in real time. It displays the total amount of data that has been
 transferred over a network device since the last reboot, the current bandwidth
 usage, and the minimum, maximum, and average bandwidth usage measured
 since it started.
 .
 If the user wants, it is also able to display two bars, similar to progress
 bars, presenting the current load graphically. Support for displaying several
 devices simultaneously is included.
